# php-alarm
A CLI alarm made in PHP

Currently only Linux supported.

<h4>How i configured this alarm:</h4><br>

<pre>
I run the script on my raspberry pi 4B which is connected to a radio with an aux cable.
I connect to my pi with RDP, (Xrdp installed on the pi).
then i'll start the script from there -> stop the RDP session -> go to sleep.
The most fun way to wake up is to put your own custom sounds in the 'sounds/' directory, songs like the samsung alarm drip version.
</pre>


<p>You can add as many alarms in the json file as you want, there is no limit.</p><br>
<p>But i do recoment to keep it clean because it will be a mess if you configure to much alarms.</p>
