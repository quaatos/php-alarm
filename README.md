A CLI alarm made in PHP

How i configured this alarm:<br>

I run the script on my raspberry pi 4B which is connected to a radio with an aux cable.<br>
Then i'll connect to my pi with RDP, (Xrdp installed on the pi) then i'll start the script from there -> stop the RDP session -> go to sleep.<br>
The most fun way to wake up is to put your own custom sounds in the 'sounds/' directory, songs like the samsung alarm drip version.<br>
